        <p className='text-center mt-10 leading-relaxed'>I am Sreehari, an IT student at Bannari Amman Institute of Technology. <br /> This project is a front-end development project I created as part of my college coursework. <br />

The goal of this project is to practice and showcase my skills in front-end development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and modern frameworks. <br /> It demonstrates concepts such as responsive design, user interface components, navigation, and interactivity. <br />

This project is purely front-end. It does not include backend functionality or database integration, so it will not perform real data operations. <br /> The focus is entirely on visual presentation, layout, and client-side logic. <br />

The project is intended solely for educational purposes, helping me understand front-end workflows and best practices, and to serve as a reference for academic evaluation.</p>
